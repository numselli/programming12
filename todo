Exercise 7 - Matching Game:
Create a matching game on a 4x4 grid. 

Steps: 

Create a 4 x 4 array 
Fill the array with pairs 
Shuffle the array (ie. shuffle the deck) 
Display the blank grid 
Prompt the user to choose 2 squares 
Check if squares are valid - within range of array 
Check squares have not already been chosen 
Check if squares match 
Display grid showing cards that have been matched 
Switch players 
Repeat 

Note: don't allow the user to choose a card that has already been matched 



Exercise 8 â€“ Penny Pitch 
The Penny Pitch game is popular in amusement parks. Pennies are tossed onto a board that has certain areas marked with different prizes. For example: 

PUZZLE |        | POSTER |        | DOLL
       | POSTER |        |  DOLL  | BALL
       | PUZZLE |  GAME  |        |           
PUZZLE |  BALL  |        | POSTER | POSTER
DOLL   |  GAME  |        |        | BALL

The prizes available on this board are puzzle, game, ball, poster, and doll. At the end of the game, if all of the squares that say BALL are covered by a penny, the player gets the ball. This is also true for the other prizes. The board is made up of 25 squares (5 x 5). Each prize appears on three randomly chosen squares so that 15 squares contain prizes.   

Create a PennyPitch application that displays a Penny Pitch board (use [ and ] to indicate squares) with prizes randomly placed and then simulates ten pennies being randomly pitched onto the board. After the pennies have been pitched, the application should display a message indicating which prizes have been won, it any. 




Exercise 9: Mini Battleship:
Build a battleship game using a 2D array.  
Build a 5 x 5 grid 
Have the ability to place a ship anywhere on the grid (start with two ships) 
Prompt the user to guess the location 
Create a 2 player version either Player vs Player or Player vs Computer 

Extension: 
Create a 10 x 10 grid 
Place more than 1 ship 
Prevent people from placing the ship off the grid (or on top of another ship) 

Rough Algorithm: 
Create 2D Array - 10x10 or 5x5 
Initialize the array 
Print the array 
Place ship(s) - 5 ships (5 spaces to 2 spaces) - 2 ships minimum (3 spaces) 
Check for valid ship location - stay on the grid, not crossing another ship 
Computer or Player2 place their ships 

Play game 
Prompt for row and column 
Check for hit 
Computer or Player 2 turn
